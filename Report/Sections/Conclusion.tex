\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we have explored the design and simulation of an LNA using a BFP420 transistor. The design process involved determining the biasing conditions, and optimizing the circuit for low noise figure and high gain. The simulation results demonstrated that the LNA meets the design specifications, achieving a noise figure of 2.2 dB and a gain of 13 dB at a frequency of 4 GHz, which are satisfactory results.

The design process also highlighted the importance of careful component selection to minimize noise and maximize performance. The use of simulation tools allowed us to validate our design choices and make necessary adjustments before finalizing the circuit.

The final circuit design, which includes optimized input and output matching networks, was successfully designed using microstrip lines. This choice of microstrip implementation provided several advantages, such as lower parasitic effects, better power handling, and improved thermal stability, contributing to the overall efficiency of the LNA.

The results of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of the design and simulation process in achieving the desired performance metrics for an LNA. Future work could involve further optimization of the circuit, exploring different transistor models, or implementing additional features to enhance performance.
