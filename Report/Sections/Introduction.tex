\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}
 This report presents the design and analysis of a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) designed to operate in the ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band. In modern telecom systems, LNAs play a crucial role in dealing with low amplitude signals
 at high frequencies with high data rates. During the development of this project, advanced RF design concepts were explored, including the use of adaptive loops for impedance, stability, gain and noise within the specified frequency range (3-6 GHz). The challenges faced, and the solutions adopted are detailed in this report.

 The aim of this report is to comprehensively document the process of designing and analyzing
 a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for operation in the ISM band, with a focus on achieving critical performance specifications. The circuit will have to be designed following certain detailed specifications, starting by designing a suitable polarization network for the transistor, taking into account the effects of encapsulation.
